# COVID-19_DASHBOARD


### Overview
This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data using Power BI. The dataset includes various tables containing information about COVID-19 cases globally, country-wise, and day-wise. The analysis focuses on visualizing key metrics such as total confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and trends over time.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of the following tables:

#### USA Country_wise: Contains COVID-19 data for the USA, including daily confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries at the state level.
#### Worldometer_data: Provides global COVID-19 statistics, including total cases, deaths, recoveries, and other related metrics.
#### country_wise_latest: Offers country-wise COVID-19 data, including total confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases.
#### covid_19_Complete: Contains comprehensive COVID-19 data, including confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases at the country and province/state level.
#### Fully_grouped: Aggregates COVID-19 data globally and by country, including total confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases.
#### day_wise: Provides COVID-19 data on a daily basis, including confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases globally and by country.

### Steps Done
#### Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, missing values, and irrelevant columns.

#### Adding Calculated Columns and Measures
Created calculated columns such as mortality rate, recovery rate, and active cases.
Implemented calculated measures for metrics like new cases, new deaths, and new recoveries on a daily basis.

#### Data Modeling
Designed the data model to establish relationships between tables based on common keys such as country/region and date.
Created hierarchies and sorted data fields to facilitate navigation and analysis in Power BI.

#### Report Creation
Developed various visualizations to represent COVID-19 trends and metrics, including cards,line charts, bar charts, donut charts
Visualized trends of total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time globally and by country.
Compared COVID-19 metrics across different countries and regions.
Analyzed daily new cases, deaths, and recoveries to understand the spread and impact of the virus.
